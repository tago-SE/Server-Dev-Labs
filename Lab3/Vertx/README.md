# Problem 

Implement vert.x to receive events updating a graph in real-time and implement a method to storing the graph persistently and displaying it later.

# Solution
I attack the problems by creating two separate projects provided I can´t find a project with reasonably close approximation to what I´m trying to do. In this case I would solve (1) and (2) before putting them together and solving (3).

1) Create a basic vert.x chat app with multiple clients connected to a single server.

2) Check out examples of drawing graphs in real-time.

3) CRUD for saving and loading images and displaying them properly on the client side.
